# Boolgram - Vue3

This project is a replica of Instagram,  built using Vue3 (https://vuejs.org/) and Vite (https://vitejs.dev/guide/) as the development environment. 

> Vite is a development server that is built for Vue3, it provides a fast development experience with instant hot-reloading .

The CSS framework used in this project is Tailwind (https://tailwindcss.com/). 

> Tailwind is a utility-first CSS framework that provides a set of
> pre-defined CSS classes that can be used to style the application.
> This approach allows for a fast development process with minimal
> custom CSS.

For handling API calls, Axios get the game.

> Axios is a popular JavaScript library that allows for easy handling of
> HTTP requests. In this project, Axios is used to retrieve data from
> the API and display it in the application.

The functionalities are reduced compared to the real Instagram, it allows to view the posts and the comments, to toggle the comments section, to toggle the like button and to show an appropriate message on the comments button based on the number of comments.

The project is open source and contributions are welcome. The code is well-documented and easy to understand, trying to make a resource for learning how to build a (part) of a social media application using Vue3.
